## Guidebook

What we aim to build is the following:

A guidebook (a complete installation) is a web service that contains Editors, Collections and Documents.

Editors can CRUD Collections and Documents. Documents are written in Markdown and can be saved as draft. There are several special Markdown tags that we can use for every of the Widgets.

Widgets are objects that embed as HTML, but have a different workflow of interaction and data storage. For example, we can create a simple widget that displays a poll and insert it into Markdown by referencing its ID. This way we can easily insert a poll in a document.

For the alpha, we want to develop the base system (Editors, Collections, Documents) and the following Widgets:

- Comments
- Polls
- Runnable Code
- Charts
